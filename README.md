WhatsApp Flutter Clone

This is a Flutter-based messaging app inspired by WhatsApp. It brings the core features of WhatsApp into a clean, modern interface, including chats, status updates, and call logs. The app is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and easy to navigate, giving users a smooth messaging experience on any device.

How It Works

Chats Page:
Shows all your conversations in one place. Each chat displays the contact’s name, profile picture, last message, and the time it was sent. Tap any chat to open the conversation and start messaging.

Status Page:
Keeps you updated with your friends’ latest statuses. You can scroll through new and old updates, and see who has viewed your own status.

Calls Page:
Shows your recent voice and video calls with contact names, call types (incoming, outgoing, or missed), and timestamps. You can quickly start a new call directly from this page.

Navigation:
Easily switch between Chats, Status, and Calls using the tab bar at the top. Each page is optimized with proper spacing and scrolling so everything looks clean and organized.
